# MacOS custom shortcuts cheatsheet widget
---
Simple app that adds a widget to MacOS using WidgetKit 

The widget shows keyboard shortcuts for the app you choose in widget settings 

You can add multiple widgets and select a different app for each one

Just move your mouse to the top-right corner of your desktop at any time, and you'll see the widgets 

It's an easy and quick way to access keyboard shortcuts :)

It doesnt read shortcuts from other apps, shortcuts are hardcoded right in the [code](https://github.com/Git-I985/shortcuts-macos-widget/blob/main/ShortcutsWidget/SelectAppIntent.swift#L63)
